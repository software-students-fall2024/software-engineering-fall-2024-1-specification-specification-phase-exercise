## Stakeholders

Our Target End-Users are college students.

NYU Senior 1: The most important aspect of a study/class management app for them is for it to offer an easy way to visualize their schedule (including classes, assignments, exams, etc.) all in one place. They wished Brightspace was easier to use on the go and liked that it reminded you about assignments, but wished it offered a calendar view for them. They believe Brightspace is missing a place/way to easily connect with classmates and/or TAs to ask questions or discuss things went over in class. Finally, they would like if enrolling for courses was in the same app as where you view your classes and assignments, not in a separate app.

NYU Undegraduate Alumni & Current Undergrad Student: 

Interviewer: What parts of brightspace do you think are beneficial/helpful as a student? 

Student: Brightspace’s organization is its strongpoint. Having specific sections for the content, discussion, assignments, and etc… for a class makes it easier to 
access the information I need. 

Interviewer: Are there any parts that you feel don’t work or aren’t helpful at all? 

Student: There are a lot of aspects of brightspace that I never use or click on. Most of the stuff under the ‘More Tools’ tab and ‘Course Reports’ tab I have never really used while nyu has used brightspace. There has also been many times where classes I've taken have used another resource to submit assignments like Gradescope or event email. If brightspace had more extensive grading capabilities then professors wouldn't need to use multiple different sites to grade and collect assignments. 

Interviewer: What tool do you wish Brightspace had that would make your life as a student easier?

Student: Adding a tab specifically for the syllabus would make things much easier for me because that’s the piece of information for the class that I’ll be revisiting for the 
whole length of the course. 

Interviewer: What do you think is the most important part of a student platform like brightspace? 

Student: The most important thing that I would look for in a platform like brightspace is to have everything I can so that I can be successful. Here are 3 things I'd like to see improved upon
    * I would want the syllabus to be right there in a tab once I click on a class
    * I want assignments tab to be more utilized by the professors
    * I want a tab where you can access the professors availability and easily sign up for office hours without having to email them about setting a time
