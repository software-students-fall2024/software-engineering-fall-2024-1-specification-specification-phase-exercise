# Specification Phase Exercise

A little exercise to get started with the specification phase of the software development lifecycle. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Ideation
We are building a clean, user-friendly financial information platform that delivers accurate, government-sourced data. Instead of overwhelming users with complex news, our platform provides simplified, real-time financial graphs and user-friendly news to inspire people who are unfamiliar with finance but want to learn or start investing.

Our target audience includes beginners who feel overwhelmed by complicated financial news and find it difficult to focus on key market data. These individuals often incur losses by following subjective reports. We offer accurate, objective market information, empowering them to make informed, rational investment decisions based on knowledge and sound reasoning.
